            Throughout my career, I've worn many
            hats â€“ from coding wizard to design maestro, and for the past 5
            years, I've been steering the ship as a manager. My journey
            started with a love for crafting clean and functional code, but
            over the years, I realized the power of combining functionality
            with eye-catching design. That's where my unique blend of web
            development and design skills comes into play.
